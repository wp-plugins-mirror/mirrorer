# WP-Plugins-Mirror Mirrorer
Handles mirroring of WordPress plugins to other Github repositories in this organization.

## Reasoning
There have been plenty of plugin Git mirrors, but I none that have been consistent or exactly what I needed. So I created this to use Github actions to automate the process of creating these mirrors, and keeping them up to date.
